		<p>A second installment of &ldquo;interesting stuff I came across this month&rdquo; &hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>A 1972 article in Rolling Stone magazine by Stewart Brand: <a href="http://www.wheels.org/spacewar/stone/rolling_stone.html"><em>&ldquo;Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums&rdquo;</em></a>. If only the present had corresponded a little closer to the imagined future of the past, eh? :)</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>The hackers are the technicians of this science &ndash; <em>“It’s a term of derision and also the ultimate compliment.”</em> They are the ones who translate human demands into code that the machines can understand and act on. They are legion. <strong>Fanatics with a potent new toy</strong>. A mobile new-found elite, with its own apparat, language and character, its own legends and humor. Those magnificent men with their flying machines, scouting a leading edge of technology which has an odd softness to it; outlaw country, where rules are not decree or routine so much as the starker demands of what’s possible.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>An excellent blog that was forced offline by vociferous commentors, but lives on in the depths of the Wayback Machine: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140107054458/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/"><em>&ldquo;Surely I am Joking&rdquo;</em></a> by Yin Wang. <em>All</em> the posts are good, my favorites are the ones on the downsides of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; FP and &ldquo;pure&rdquo; OOP (and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140116155929/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2013/11/09/oop-fp">how the two are similar!</a>), the one on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131127131340/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2012/09/16/what-is-a-program/"><em>&ldquo;what is a program?&rdquo;</em></a>, and the one on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140103011845/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/database/"><em>&ldquo;dark age of programming&rdquo;</em></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A 1987 article in <em>&ldquo;Computer Language&rdquo;</em> magazine: <a href="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/extras/bph-publications/CompLang-1987-04-Hayes-mutant-lisps.pdf"><em>&ldquo;Mutant languages from the LISP lab&rdquo;</em></a> &mdash; just for fun, and an insight into the pre-Common Lisp era.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>And finally, a &ldquo;quote-of-the-month&rdquo;. This one is short and succinct <em>Perlisism</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Computer Science is embarrassed by the computer.</strong></p></blockquote>

			Monthly Programming Summary: October 2015</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Here&rsquo;s the first installment in an experiment &mdash; writing a monthly roundup of a few things I read/saw/did this month that I found sort of interesting. I do something on my (general, non-programming-specific) <a href="http://abacusnoirform.com/">personal blog</a>, so I thought the same might be a useful exercise here too.</p>

<p>In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The &ldquo;Balloon edition&rdquo; of BYTE magazine <a href="https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-08/1981_08_BYTE_06-08_Smalltalk#page/n0/mode/2up">from 1981</a> &hellip; it&rsquo;s amazing how this stuff is <em>still</em> a revolutionary idea (also, the advertisements from three decades ago are hilarious)</p></li>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;&lsquo;SHOULD I learn to program?&rsquo; and &lsquo;Do I have to learn to program?&rsquo; are two variants of the question probably most asked by people testing the waters of computer ownership. The answer usually boils down to an emphatic &lsquo;that depends &hellip;, but probably not.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em> Sounds relevant? Sounds current? In fact, this is from a New York Times article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/17/science/personal-computers-does-everyone-need-to-learn-programming.html">from 1984 (!)</a>, titled <em>&ldquo;Personal computers: Does everyone need to learn programming?&rdquo;</em> (there is a conclusion to be drawn from this, but I won&rsquo;t go there)</p></li>
<li><p>I read through Dijkstra&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/">notes</a> a while ago, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.vex.net/~trebla/ewd.html">someone else&rsquo;s curated version</a> of them.</p></li>
<li><p>A Google Tech Talk from 2007 by Alex Wright, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72nfrhXroo8"><em>&ldquo;The Web That Wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo;</em></a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with this quote from Alan Kay:</p>

<blockquote><p>Perhaps it was commercialization in the 1980s that killed off the next expected new thing. Our plan and our hope was that the next generation of kids would come along and do something better than Smalltalk around 1984 or so. We all thought that the next level of programming language would be much more strategic and even policy-oriented and would have much more knowledge about what it was trying to do. But a variety of different things conspired together, and that next generation actually didn’t show up. <strong>One could actually argue—as I sometimes do—that the success of commercial personal computing and operating systems has actually led to a considerable retrogression in many, many respects.</strong></p></blockquote>

		<a href="/blog/2015/10/08/a-taste-of-j/">
		
			A Tiny Taste of J</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I recently stumbled across APL and J, as mentioned in a previous post, and began reading a bit of <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/learning/contents.htm">an introductory book</a>.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, I came across this series of coding tasks on a blog called &ldquo;Programming Praxis&rdquo;, and I picked <a href="http://programmingpraxis.com/2015/10/06/the-iron-bar/">the most recent one</a> as an example to try out some J noobism.</p>

<p>The example is simple but contrived (and <em>median</em> is a terrible name) &mdash; we basically have to write a function that that takes two arguments and either increments, decrements or does nothing, with the first argument. In J, like so many other tasks, this is essentially one line (12 characters, to be precise).</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>median =: [ + (* @: -)~</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To give some idea on what&rsquo;s going on here, this expression can be broken, first, into three parts: <code>[</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>(* @: -)~</code>. Let&rsquo;s start with the sub-expression within the parentheses: <code>* @: -</code>.</p>

<p>Here, <code>*</code> is a <em>verb</em> (think: <em>&ldquo;function&rdquo;</em>) that returns 1, 0, or -1 depending on the sign of its argument. So <code>* 4</code> is <code>1</code>, <code>* _2</code> (that&rsquo;s how -2 is represented) is <code>_1</code>, <code>* 0</code> is <code>0</code>.</p>

<p><code>-</code> is the only thing that does what you would expect: <code>4 - 3</code> is <code>1</code>, and so on.</p>

<p><code>@:</code> is a <em>conjunction</em>, such that <code>f @: g</code> when applied to <em>x</em> has the effect of <em>f (g x)</em>.</p>

<p><code>]</code> is a verb that when given two values, always selects the first of the two.</p>

<p><code>~</code> is an <em>adverb</em> that reverses the order of arguments to its preceding verb. So while <code>%</code> applied to <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> yields <em>(x % y)</em>, <code>%~</code> applied to <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> yields <em>(y % x)</em>.</p>

<p>Now things get a little tricky (but only a <em>little</em>; we&rsquo;re barely scratching the surface of J here). The expression for median can be seen as three verbs laid down together, and this is interpreted as a <em>&ldquo;train&rdquo;</em> of verbs, or more specifically in this case, a <em>&ldquo;dyadic fork&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Basically, <em>(f g h)</em> when applied to two values <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, is equivalent to <em>g</em> applied to the result of <em>f</em> applied to <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, and the result of <em>h</em> applied to <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. Or, using infix notation,</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>x (f g h) y   is equivalent to    (x f y) g (x h y)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The reason <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> aren&rsquo;t present in the definition of <em>median</em> is that it&rsquo;s defined using a &ldquo;tacit&rdquo; form rather than an &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; form (somewhat similar to &ldquo;point-free&rdquo; definitions in Haskell).</p>

<p>Putting it all together now, when applied to two arguments, we get the equivalent of <code>(x [ y) + (* (y - x))</code>, which gives <code>x + 1</code> when <em>y > x</em>, <code>x + 0</code> when <em>y == x</em>, and <code>x + (-1)</code> when <em>y &lt; x</em>, which is what we want.</p>

		<p>(Don&rsquo;t ask me why or how I got here, but &hellip;) I came across a very old (Nov 1980) <a href="http://ml.cddddr.org/lisp-forum/msg00022.html">post in a mailing list</a> that might be related to our current confusion on the different interpretations of what <em>types</em> mean:</p>

<blockquote><p> The second way is to keep careful tabs on what functions call this one and the way that they have to be changed to match changes in this function.  It is exactly this latter type of control (auditing function) that I mean should be included in NIL (or whatever).  I am not against extending the language any more than I am against GOTOs (which is not very much).</p></blockquote>

			On Mathematical Notation &#8230;</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a vague lingering feeling about mathematical notation being at times inconsistent, excessive, duplicated, and so on. Some of it is of course due to me not knowing enough math, and not knowing math well enough, but some of it, I was recently relieved to find out, was a concern shared by people smarter than me too.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m now <em>more</em> confused since the two solutions are (IMO) at odds with each other. Both share the common goal of replacing outdated notation by making it <em>&ldquo;executable&rdquo;</em>, and thus more precise, but the way they go about it is different.</p>

<p>Or so it seems to me, at least. Perhaps someone out there can explain it better to me someday. The two people I came across are, (of course?) Ken Iverson and Gerald Sussman, and the two ideas can be experienced by reading <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm"><em>&ldquo;Notation as a Tool of Thought&rdquo;</em></a>, and watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arMH5GjBwUQ"><em>&ldquo;The Role of Programming in the Formulation of Ideas&rdquo;</em></a>. Enjoy.</p>

			The Field of Languages &#8230;</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last year, I spent some time trying out Haskell, Ocaml, Clojure, Dart, Shen, and ClozureCL. I thought I was done surveying the field, but I had barely scratched the surface, and realizing this was quite depressing. There are entire <em>kinds</em> of language paradigms I have no experience of, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Forth</strong>: All I&rsquo;ve done is read about people&rsquo;s experience with it, it has always seemed too alien to me.</li>
<li><strong>Smalltalk</strong>: I installed Pharo and took the basic &ldquo;Prof. Stef&rdquo; tutorial, but then stopped before I could really try anything concrete.</li>
<li><strong>APL/J</strong>: Never seemed like anything but line noise, but then I read <a href="https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/a-look-at-the-j-language-the-fine-line-between-genius-and-insanity/">this post on J</a> and saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlM9BXfu7UY">this video</a> on Dyalog, and I&rsquo;m curious about it</li>

			Internet Ironies and Idiosyncrasies</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A couple of snippets dug up from the past &hellip;</p>

<h2>The Anatomy of a Search Engine</h2>

<p>(original <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~page/google.html">here</a>, emphasis mine, presented without comment)</p>

<blockquote><p>Currently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. <em>The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users</em>. For example, in our prototype search engine the top result for cellular phone is &ldquo;The Effect of Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention&rdquo;, a study which explains in great detail the distractions and risk associated with conversing on a cell phone while driving. This search result came up first because of its high importance as judged by the PageRank algorithm, an approximation of citation importance on the web [Page, 98]. It is clear that <em>a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers</em>. For this type of reason and historical experience with other media [Bagdikian 83], <strong>we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h2>&ldquo;Other people&rdquo; on the Internet</h2>

<p>(original <a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2003/02/16/google-blogs/">here</a>, emphasis mine)</p>

<blockquote><p> We’ve had the technological capability to “blog” since the creation of the Worldwide Web. The difference now is that it’s getting easier and easier to do. That’s the shift. <strong>More and more content is getting created, and the content is getting increasingly time sensitive in nature</strong>. Given a user-friendly piece of software and a 15 minute introduction, my grandmother or my teenage nephew is just as capable of publishing content on the open internet as I am. And, given the relative free time that each of them probably enjoys, you might say that they’re quite a bit more capable than I am.</p>

<p>So, does this have value? I’d say the answer is “yes” and “no”, with a much heavier weight on the “no”. For my grandmother, in this example, it’s “yes”. Maybe she just wants to write for herself (nevermind the fact that she can do that in a paper journal where people don’t have to read it). Maybe she wants to keep her globally distributed family up to date on the events of her life. To be able to do these things easily is great for her.</p>

<p><strong>But, for the internet as a whole, the answer is “no”</strong>. Nothing against my grandmother of course, but this “blogging” phenomenon is opening the flood gates for anyone with an internet connection to “muddy up” the information available on the internet even further than it already is. While bloggers are probably adding some valuable content to the internet, they’re also increasing the number of sites that fall into my #1,2,3 categories mentioned above. In fact, Pyra itself has 1.1 million registered users, out of which they estimate that only the 200,000 are actively maintaining sites. This means that while Blogger brings us 200,000 sites that at least don’t fall into the “inactive” category (but may still be generally useless or irrelevant), <strong>it has also helped to dilute the internet</strong> with about 900,000 dormant sites.</p>

<p>Given those numbers (about 80% of Blogger sites in category #3 alone), I’d have to say that <strong>“blogging” is more of a problem than it is something to be excited about</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>More than a decade ago, and people have moved on from blogs (<em>yawn?</em>) to a variety of comfortable walled gardens, but substitute Twitter above and add a few zeros to the numbers here, and you get a rough idea of what has (or has not) changed since then.</p>

			A BigQuery Example</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I had read about BigQuery but hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to use the external product yet. This week I came across some article about Uber and taxis etc, and it had a link to recently released data by <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/statistics.shtml">The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission</a>. In addition to directly downloading the data, or looking at it through <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/data?agency=Taxi+and+Limousine+Commission+%28TLC%29&amp;cat=&amp;type=new_view&amp;browseSearch=&amp;scope">NYC OpenData</a>, you can also <a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/nyc-tlc:yellow.trips_2015">play around with it using BigQuery</a>.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s a sample I threw together:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">trip_distance</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fare_amount</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tip_amount</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tolls_amount</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">tip_amount</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">fare_amount</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">tip_ratio</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">nyc</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">tlc</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">yellow</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">trips_2015</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">fare_amount</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">50</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">trip_distance</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">15</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">passenger_count</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">8</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">trip_distance</span> <span class="k">DESC</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The screenshot shows the cached results, it took about 6 seconds to run (which is not bad, considering the dataset is about <em>10 Gigs</em> !!)</p>

			Shokunin and Umami in Software Engineering &#8230;.</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Saw a great movie yesterday, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-aGPniFvS0">&ldquo;Jiro dreams of Sushi&rdquo;</a>, which is really all about the lifelong quest for perfection. Chef Jiro Ono has been making Sushi for seven decades, and is still trying to get better at it.</p>

<p>Which is admirable, but how can lesser mortals as us draw some inspiration from it? What is the equivalent of being a <em>Shokunin</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in terms of programming (or realistically, in terms of software engineering)? What is the equivalent experience of <em>Umami</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>?</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p><em>The Japanese word shokunin is defined by both Japanese and Japanese-English dictionaries as ‘craftsman’ or ‘artisan,’ but such a literal description does not fully express the deeper meaning.  The Japanese apprentice is taught that shokunin means not only having technical skills, but also implies an attitude and social consciousness. … The shokunin has a social obligation to work his/her best for the general welfare of the people.  This obligation is both spiritual and material, in that no matter what it is, the shokunin’s responsibility is to fulfill the requirement.</em> &mdash; <a href="https://wilsonkhoo.wordpress.com/2013/02/23/jiro-dreams-of-sushi-what-it-means-to-be-shokunin/">Tasio Odate</a><a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p><em>As the taste of umami itself is subtle and blends well with other tastes to expand and round out flavors, most people don&rsquo;t recognize umami when they encounter it, but it plays an important role making food taste delicious.</em> <a href="http://www.umamiinfo.com/2011/02/What-exactly-is-umami.php">(reference)</a><a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
