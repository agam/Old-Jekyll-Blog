Using all three (`val`, `var`, `d

ef`), I initialize, and then attempt to reassign. Only `var` succeeds (as it should), but the other two fail in different ways.

```scala

scala> val x = 6
x: Int = 6

scala> x = 7
<console>:11: error: reassignment to val
       x = 7
         ^

scala> var x = 6
x: Int = 6

scala> x = 7
x: Int = 7

scala> def x = 6
x: Int

scala> x = 7
<console>:11: error: value x_= is not a member of object $iw
       x = 7
       ^

```

Deceptively similar at first, but I suppose you get used to it. Also, what the heck is `$iw` ?? (I'm guessing it's an internal Java representation of the `Int` class)
