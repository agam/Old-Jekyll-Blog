<title>SlimV and Vim as an equivalent to Emacs and Slime</title>

<h1 id="slimv-and-vim">SlimV and Vim</h1>
<p>I’ve switched between Emacs and Vim a few times over the last 15-odd years, before finally (?) settling on Vim. I’ve come to the realization, as many have before me, that for all the elegant awesomeness of Emacs Lisp,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vim is a better <em>text</em> editor, Emacs is good for everything else</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps one day if <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile</a> or <a href="https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/shanecelis/1">Emacsey</a> deliver their full promise, I’ll happily live inside a REPL forever.</p>
<p>Until then, it’s just <em>much, much, much</em> faster to do the equivalent <em>text</em> operations in Vim than in Emacs (yes, I mapped CapsLock to Control; yes, I replaced <code>M-</code> by <code>C-xC-m-</code>).</p>
<p>There were still a few Emacs-only things that haunted me (I outgrew the need to have a <a href="http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/">web browser</a> or an <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/erc.html">IRC client</a> in my editor environment, I now use Google Chrome for the former and BitchX/Irssi/Xchat for the latter. I also don’t mind reading my <a href="http://gmail.com">email</a> in the browser), such as <a href="http://orgmode.org/"><code>org-mode</code></a>. Fortunately for me, I don’t most of its features, and keeping a timestamped diary is something I was able to fix for myself with some shell scripting and vim shortcuts.</p>
<p>Recently, I decided to learn Common Lisp with as much of a newbie attitude as possible. And here I ran into a veritable wall of convention. <em>Of course, didn’t I know, that Emacs + Slime is the one true way ?</em></p>
<p>I dithered, was flustered and nearly reconsidered.</p>
<p>And then I discovered the awesomeness I was looking for, a replacement for Slime in Vim, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2531">Slimv</a>!</p>
<p><a href="http://kovisoft.bitbucket.org/tutorial.html">Here is a tutorial</a> to get you started, but basically all I had to do was to install the plugin and the rest pretty much <em>just worked</em>.</p>
<p>There are quite a lot of nifty tricks here, but my most frequently used commands are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>,L</code>: that’s a comma followed by L): compile current file</li>
<li><code>,D</code>: compile current form</li>
<li><code>,s</code>: lookup a short summary description of the keyword under the cursor</li>
<li><code>,c</code>: Open Slimv session (splits the window horizontally)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was also new to <code>paredit mode</code>, which is pretty much necessary for making changes to heavily nested parantheses, and it has useful commands there too:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>,W</code>: wrap an extra set of parentheses around the current form</li>
<li><code>,S</code>: it’s opposite; remove <em>one</em> set of parentheses from the current form</li>
<li><code>,&lt;</code>, <code>,&gt;</code>: move the parentheses under the cursor one form to the left or right</li>
</ul>
<p>… and much more. So next time someone tells you how <code>Slime</code> is indispensable and hence Emacs is indispensable, throw Slimv in their face! Kudos to <a href="http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=16470">the guy who built it</a>!</p>
