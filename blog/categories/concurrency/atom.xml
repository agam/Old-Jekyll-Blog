    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so I went through the <a href="http://tour.golang.org/">Go Tour</a>, and it&rsquo;s pretty impressive; having this sort of super-fast edit-compile-run cycle is something usually associated with Javascript-ish languages, certainly not a statically compiled systems language.</p>

<p>One of the big selling points of Go (apart from its &ldquo;familiar&rdquo; yet clean syntax) is the ubiquitous concurrency primitives available. Yes, you could obviously do the same in other languages (see a good <a href="http://blog.drewolson.org/blog/2013/07/04/clojure-core-dot-async-and-go-a-code-comparison/">Clojure translation here</a>), but channels and goroutines being first-class objects in Go, passing them is as normal as ints and strings.</p>

<p>Except its not really that normal, is it? But it <em>should</em> be. So I thought, why not try out something that I called &ldquo;ridiculous concurrency&rdquo;, a sort of roundabout way of doing normal stuff, while <em>overusing</em> concurrency.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t meant to be a good way of showing how to do anything, but rather <strong>making it easy to <em>abuse</em> concurrency, so that you can later <em>use</em> it</strong>.</p>
