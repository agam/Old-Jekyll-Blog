    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been using <a href="http://xmonad.org/">Xmonad</a> for almost a couple of years, mostly because I wanted a tiling window manager that would maximize screen space and allow fast window and desktop switching on my linux laptop.</p>

<p>Recently, I decided to go back to a full-fledged desktop environment again, and I (randomly (please, no &ldquo;Gnome vs Kde&rdquo; flamewar)) picked KDE. The last time I used it was maybe 8 years ago (!), and I was eager to see what I had been missing.</p>

<p>It seems to have gotten better in the same sense that all linux software has gotten better in the last several years (and the machine I&rsquo;m running it on has gotten much faster too!), but I particularly liked the idea of <a href="http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma#Activities">Activities</a>, being somewhat orthogonal to the idea of multiple desktops, and I found it useful to add &ldquo;work&rdquo;, &ldquo;browsing&rdquo;, &ldquo;writing&rdquo; etc areas.</p>

<h2>Minor tweaks</h2>

<p>I had to change the screen rotation of one of my monitors at my desktop, but this was fairly straightforward: [System Settings] &ndash;> [Display &amp; Monitor] &ndash;> [Size &amp; Orientation]</p>

<p>I also always get rid of the useless Caps Lock: [System Settings] &ndash;> [Input Devices] &ndash;> [Keyboard]</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s one issue which I&rsquo;m not quite sure about &mdash; I encountered a <code>no d-bus daemon running</code> message, which I fixed by <code>export $(dbus-launch)</code>, and I haven&rsquo;t encountered it since, but I haven&rsquo;t read up enough to know if this requires some more setup.</p>

<p>I had an <code>xscreensaver</code> lock alias earlier, and I wanted something similar; I assigned <code>klock</code> to <code>/usr/lib/kde4/libexec/kscreenlocker --forcelock</code></p>

<p>Finally, I need a way to setup easy terminal access. I setup <code>Meta+T</code> to run <code>konsole</code>, <code>Meta+R</code> to run <code>krunner</code> (which brings up a &ldquo;quick run&rdquo; box), and (I love this part) installed <code>yakuake</code> which I mapped to <code>Meta+`</code>.</p>

<h2>Other switches considered: Firefox</h2>

<p>I tried moving to Firefox for a while, but I really found it slower than Google Chrome. OK, I didn&rsquo;t personally benchmark it, but several content-heavy websites seemed to load slower.</p>

<p>Also, I had gotten used to certain workflows in Chrome (such as entering <code>amazon.com</code>, hitting <code>Tab</code> and then typing what I wanted to search within Amazon) which were no longer possible with Firefox, and I didn&rsquo;t want to take the productivity hit.</p>

<p>However, I installed the Android app, and activated Firefox Sync and everything worked pretty well. Honestly, I liked the mobile app better. But this is one of those all or nothing switches, since the &ldquo;tab syncing&rdquo; between desktop/laptop/mobile browsers is indispensable to me.</p>

<p>I will definitely consider this in the future again, especially if Firefox&rsquo;s rendering speed improves w.r.t. Chrome.</p>

<h2>Other switches considered: Emacs</h2>

<p>This is one of those eternal conflicts, as I mentioned in <a href="/blog/2013/08/06/slimv/">a previous post</a>. I keep wanting to switch to Emacs, but Vim always remains atleast an order of magnitude faster for me, for most common tasks, so I just can&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>As I see it, nothing which begins with <code>C-u</code> can ever be faster than the equivalent two-character command in Vim (in particular, <code>C-x z</code> is 10 times slower than just <code>.</code>).</p>

<p>Recently, I was discussing this with a few colleagues, and one of the things that was suggested was <code>Viper</code>-mode in Emacs as a halfway compromise.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll look into it, see what keystrokes are supported, and if my regular workflow is unaffected, this too might be a switch I&rsquo;d be willing to make in the future.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: I have since switched from the linux laptop I was doing this on,
to a Chromebook, making the discussion somewhat moot now. However, I am still
using KDE on a desktop environment and loving it.</p>
