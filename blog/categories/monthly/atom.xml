    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Again, this isn’t really restricted to <em>Programming</em> per se, but more generally “computer-related stuff”. Next time, I’ll pick a better name. Until then, here are a few interesting links I came across last month, in no  particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Handbook of Lisp Functions (cover page below): a <a href="http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/mblisp/Handbook_of_LISP_Functions.pdf">technical report</a> from <em>1961</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>{% img <a href="https://doc-14-48-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/o7m1hv4d96s4jtg9a81aobcff174890t/49eh1go9f5v2i53agksqnv1ghn4m8mj9/1453780800000/03675759775475626385/03675759775475626385/0B7bvhABhpDqmMmRPQmRvWXpkZTg">https://doc-14-48-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/o7m1hv4d96s4jtg9a81aobcff174890t/49eh1go9f5v2i53agksqnv1ghn4m8mj9/1453780800000/03675759775475626385/03675759775475626385/0B7bvhABhpDqmMmRPQmRvWXpkZTg</a> %}</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Digression on learning new languages: Ugh, I’m too embarassed to even write this. I keep changing my mind about what I like more. I thought this was going to be “the year of Clojure” for me, but then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dart-Programming-Language-Gilad-Bracha/dp/0321927702#">Gilad Bracha’s book</a> came out and now I’m torn again (Can I have them <em>both</em>? Maybe, but I fear I don’t have that kind of time anymore :P)</p></li>
<li><p>Busting the myths behind MicroKernels: <a href="http://blog.darknedgy.net/technology/2016/01/01/0/"><em>”Microkernels are slow and Elvis didn’t do no drugs”</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>Here is a paper from 1982 (<a href="http://www.smecc.org/The%20Architecture%20%20of%20the%20Burroughs%20B-5000.htm"><em>”The Architecture of the Burroughs B5000 &ndash; 20 Years Later and Still Ahead of the Times?”</em></a>), which was <em>even then</em> lamenting the sorry state of hardware, and only seems quaint now (as in <em>”why would you do things different?”</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>Various ways to make Clojure programming more productive: <a href="http://dev.solita.fi/2014/03/18/pimp-my-repl.html"><em>”Pimp My REPL”</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>I had a bunch of entertaining blog posts by Crista Lopez in the past (e.g. <a href="http://tagide.com/blog/fiction/jedi-masters/"><em>”Jedi Masters”</em></a>), but was blown away by this set of slides. You’re a programmer, you want to be a programmer for life, you <em>have</em> to read this: <a href="http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-aar-2013/slides/CristinaVideiraLopes_ExercisesInStyle.pdf"><em>”Exercises in Programming Style”</em></a>. And if you really like it, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371">get the book</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Came across this intriguing indie film trailer (<a href="https://vimeo.com/147111732"><em>”TraceRoute”</em></a>), though I haven’t gotten around to seeing the movie yet (the writer/protagonist navigates “… the ghosts of nerddom’s past present and future …”). Dunno, added it to my “to watch” list.</p></li>
<li><p>Obviously, the X-Files is back. If you like this sort of stuff, the first episode <a href="http://www.fox.com/watch/607308867569/7756658688">is free to watch</a> on Fox. Go watch it :)</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of articles for “historical interest”. The first is the New York Times reporting on … <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/22/business/the-new-york-times-introduces-a-web-site.html">the opening of its web site, in 1996!</a>. But really, you skip ahead to the very last line for your dose of irony-or-tragedy: <em>“The market is booming for newspapers on the World Wide Web”</em>. Ouch.</p></li>
<li><p>The second is hilarious, from even further back (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/25/science/value-of-windowing-is-questioned.html"><em>”Value of Windowing is Questioned”</em></a>, 1984!!), and here the Times speculates on the dubious value of a graphical user interface. The opening line asks: <em>“Does anyone do windows any more?”</em>, and the article concludes by predicting “doom” for the upcoming new OS by Microsoft. I thought I’d see if the author had time to reflect on his past predictions, so I looked through the newspaper’s archives, but it looks like he stopped writing technology articles in 1987 and switched to Food and Travel. Anyway.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Here’s a “quote of the month” for you:</p>

<blockquote><p>Science is much more ‘sloppy’ and ‘irrational’ than its methodological image.</p></blockquote>

<p>(Paul Feyerabend, <em>Against Method</em>, and I meant to refer to the so-called science of computers)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A second installment of &ldquo;interesting stuff I came across this month&rdquo; &hellip;</p>

<p>(<em>Aside:</em> I shouldn&rsquo;t call this a &ldquo;programming&rdquo; summary, but I can&rsquo;t think of anything better &mdash; it&rsquo;s more of a &ldquo;math + science + computers&rdquo; newsletter)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The highlight of the last month for me was the realization of the dream of an ultra-cheap computer, the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/">Raspberry Pi Zero</a>, which is cheaper than several drinks at Starbucks.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, ants displaying &ldquo;collective intelligence&rdquo; is old stuff (I first encountered a reference to it in the pages of <em>Godel, Escher, Bach</em>), but <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/army-ants-living-bridges-suggest-collective-intelligence">this article</a> is something else altogether, showing how &ldquo;living bridges&rdquo; are dynamically adjusted by the constituent ants, in response to foraaging needs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;Get Lamp&rdquo;</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZxUGmqSOo">link to trailer</a>) is an interesting documentary on the history of interactive text-based fiction, mostly adventure games. If you&rsquo;ve ever telneted to a MUD, you will like this.</p></li>
<li><p>I lap up everything by Bret Victor, and hope for him to turn out as the Alan Kay of our time. <a href="https://medium.com/re-form/the-utopian-ui-architect-34dead42a28#.emrat4pnv">This</a> is aanother recent piece where he insists we haven&rsquo;t really <em>used</em> computers well at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a18343/the-cannons-on-the-b-29-bomber-were-a-mid-century-engineering-masterpiece/">this Popular Mechanics article</a> blew me away &mdash; before there were &ldquo;real&rdquo; computers, the B-29 Superfortress had high-tech computing <em>way</em> ahead of its time, to remotely operate its gun turrets. Obligatory youtube video below:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This month&rsquo;s QOTM is from Bret Victor&rsquo;s piece above:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now we’re staring at computer screens and moving our hands on a keyboard, but it’s basically the same thing. <strong>We’re computer users thinking paper thoughts.”</strong></p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A second installment of &ldquo;interesting stuff I came across this month&rdquo; &hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>A 1972 article in Rolling Stone magazine by Stewart Brand: <a href="http://www.wheels.org/spacewar/stone/rolling_stone.html"><em>&ldquo;Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums&rdquo;</em></a>. If only the present had corresponded a little closer to the imagined future of the past, eh? :)</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>The hackers are the technicians of this science &ndash; <em>“It’s a term of derision and also the ultimate compliment.”</em> They are the ones who translate human demands into code that the machines can understand and act on. They are legion. <strong>Fanatics with a potent new toy</strong>. A mobile new-found elite, with its own apparat, language and character, its own legends and humor. Those magnificent men with their flying machines, scouting a leading edge of technology which has an odd softness to it; outlaw country, where rules are not decree or routine so much as the starker demands of what’s possible.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>An excellent blog that was forced offline by vociferous commentors, but lives on in the depths of the Wayback Machine: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140107054458/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/"><em>&ldquo;Surely I am Joking&rdquo;</em></a> by Yin Wang. <em>All</em> the posts are good, my favorites are the ones on the downsides of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; FP and &ldquo;pure&rdquo; OOP (and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140116155929/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2013/11/09/oop-fp">how the two are similar!</a>), the one on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131127131340/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2012/09/16/what-is-a-program/"><em>&ldquo;what is a program?&rdquo;</em></a>, and the one on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140103011845/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/database/"><em>&ldquo;dark age of programming&rdquo;</em></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A 1987 article in <em>&ldquo;Computer Language&rdquo;</em> magazine: <a href="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/extras/bph-publications/CompLang-1987-04-Hayes-mutant-lisps.pdf"><em>&ldquo;Mutant languages from the LISP lab&rdquo;</em></a> &mdash; just for fun, and an insight into the pre-Common Lisp era.</p></li>
<li><p>A humorous blog entry from 2009: <a href="http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html"><em>&ldquo;A Brief, Incomplete, and Mostly Wrong History of Programming Languages&rdquo;</em></a>, with a self-explanatory title.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And finally, a &ldquo;quote-of-the-month&rdquo;. This one is short and succinct <em>Perlisism</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Computer Science is embarrassed by the computer.</strong></p></blockquote>

    <link href="http://agam.github.io/blog/2015/10/26/monthly-programming-summary/"/>
    <updated>2015-10-26T20:23:36-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://agam.github.io/blog/2015/10/26/monthly-programming-summary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s the first installment in an experiment &mdash; writing a monthly roundup of a few things I read/saw/did this month that I found sort of interesting. I do something on my (general, non-programming-specific) <a href="http://abacusnoirform.com/">personal blog</a>, so I thought the same might be a useful exercise here too.</p>

<p>In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The &ldquo;Balloon edition&rdquo; of BYTE magazine <a href="https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-08/1981_08_BYTE_06-08_Smalltalk#page/n0/mode/2up">from 1981</a> &hellip; it&rsquo;s amazing how this stuff is <em>still</em> a revolutionary idea (also, the advertisements from three decades ago are hilarious)</p></li>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;&lsquo;SHOULD I learn to program?&rsquo; and &lsquo;Do I have to learn to program?&rsquo; are two variants of the question probably most asked by people testing the waters of computer ownership. The answer usually boils down to an emphatic &lsquo;that depends &hellip;, but probably not.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em> Sounds relevant? Sounds current? In fact, this is from a New York Times article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/17/science/personal-computers-does-everyone-need-to-learn-programming.html">from 1984 (!)</a>, titled <em>&ldquo;Personal computers: Does everyone need to learn programming?&rdquo;</em> (there is a conclusion to be drawn from this, but I won&rsquo;t go there)</p></li>
<li><p>I read through Dijkstra&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/">notes</a> a while ago, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.vex.net/~trebla/ewd.html">someone else&rsquo;s curated version</a> of them.</p></li>
<li><p>A Google Tech Talk from 2007 by Alex Wright, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72nfrhXroo8"><em>&ldquo;The Web That Wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo;</em></a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with this quote from Alan Kay:</p>

<blockquote><p>Perhaps it was commercialization in the 1980s that killed off the next expected new thing. Our plan and our hope was that the next generation of kids would come along and do something better than Smalltalk around 1984 or so. We all thought that the next level of programming language would be much more strategic and even policy-oriented and would have much more knowledge about what it was trying to do. But a variety of different things conspired together, and that next generation actually didn’t show up. <strong>One could actually argue—as I sometimes do—that the success of commercial personal computing and operating systems has actually led to a considerable retrogression in many, many respects.</strong></p></blockquote>
