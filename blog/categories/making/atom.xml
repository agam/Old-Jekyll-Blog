    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Went to Maker Faire, had my mind blown <em>(as usual)</em>, and then came across this quote<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by Cory Doctorow:</p>

<blockquote><p>So today we have marketing departments who say things like ‘[…] Make me a computer that doesn’t run every program, just a program that does this specialized task, like streaming audio, or routing packets, or playing Xbox games’ […] But that’s not what we do when we turn a computer into an appliance. We’re not making a computer that runs only the “appliance” app; we’re making a computer that can run every program, but which uses some combination of rootkits, spyware, and code-signing to prevent the user from knowing which processes are running, from installing her own software, and from terminating processes that she doesn’t want. <strong>In other words, an appliance is not a stripped-down computer — it is a fully functional computer with spyware on it out of the box.</strong></p></blockquote>
