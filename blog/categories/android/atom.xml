    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had bought a MicroSD card to go along with my Motorola Razr M, since it has a limited internal storage of 8G.</p>

<p>(That is to say, <em>limited</em> by today&rsquo;s standards, where a singe Chrome tab can take up a few hundred MB. I remember when I was excited to find a computer with 8MB Ram since that meant I could play Quake on it. Anyway &hellip;)</p>

<p>I assembled everything on my (linux) laptop in one folder, this should just be a copy-and-paste, drag-and-drop kind of thing, right ?</p>

<p><em>Wrong</em>.</p>

<p>Instead I had to wade through a bunch of online forum posts, about mounting the phone on windows, on mac, configuring various settings.</p>

<p>When I plugged in the phone through USB, I got a notification saying the phone was connected but it didn&rsquo;t show up in Ubuntu&rsquo;s list of connected devices (and I know this works for other devices because my external hard drive shows up when I connect i
t).</p>

<p>Finally I found <a href="http://www.mysolutions.it/mounting-your-mtp-androids-sd-card-on-ubuntu/">this</a>, it assured me that <em>&ldquo;Fortunately, it’s quite easy to get this working&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, it was incomplete (yes, you need <code>sudo apt-get install mtpfs</code> but <em>also</em> <code>sudo apt-get install mtp-tools</code>)</p>

<p><code>sh
sudo mkdir /media/MTPDevice
sudo chmod 775 /media/MTPDevice
sudo mtpfs -o allow_other /media/MTPDevice/
</code></p>

<p>Finally, I saw</p>

<p>```sh
$ mtp-detect
libmtp version: 1.1.3</p>

<p>Listing raw device(s)
Device 0 (VID=22b8 and PID=2e51) is UNKNOWN.
Please report this VID/PID and the device model to the libmtp development team
   Found 1 device(s):
   22b8:2e51 @ bus 2, dev 9
Attempting to connect device(s)
PTP_ERROR_IO: failed to open session, trying again after resetting USB interface
LIBMTP libusb: Attempt to reset device

usb_clear_halt() on INTERRUPT endpoint: No such device
usb_open(): No such device
LIBMTP PANIC: Could not init USB on second attempt
Unable to open raw device 0
OK.
```</p>

<p>Woo hoo. So much for that.</p>

<p>Then I came across <a href="http://penzoditutto.blogspot.it/2012/12/android-mtp-devices-40-mount-scripts.html">this</a>, which seemed more pragmatic, since it said &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re using ubuntu (12.04 or 12.10) and you want to browse your Android 4.0+ device <em>you know how frustrating can be.</em>&rdquo; Yes I do.</p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t have anything fundamentally different.</p>

<p>So I just pulled out the USB cable and plugged it in again (&ldquo;when all else fails, cycle power&rdquo;)</p>

<p>This time, it worked.</p>

<p>```sh
$ mtp-detect
libmtp version: 1.1.3</p>

<p>Listing raw device(s)
Device 0 (VID=22b8 and PID=2e51) is UNKNOWN.
Please report this VID/PID and the device model to the libmtp development team
   Found 1 device(s):
   22b8:2e51 @ bus 2, dev 11

   OUT endpoint maxpacket: 512 bytes</p>

<p>&lt; &hellip; and many more pages &hellip; >
```</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re here, a clarification by way of digression: I am not ranting against MTP, just its usability. It is clearly (IMHO) better than the previous mass storage option, since it supports well-defined interfaces to specific file types, such as this one for JPEG files:</p>

<p>```sh
   3801: JPEG</p>

<pre><code>  dc01: Storage ID UINT32 data type ANY 32BIT VALUE form READ ONLY
  dc02: Object Format UINT16 data type ANY 16BIT VALUE form READ ONLY
  dc03: Protection Status UINT16 data type ANY 16BIT VALUE form READ ONLY
  dc04: Object Size UINT64 data type READ ONLY
  dc07: Object File Name STRING data type GET/SET
  dc09: Date Modified STRING data type DATETIME FORM READ ONLY
  dc0b: Parent Object UINT32 data type ANY 32BIT VALUE form READ ONLY
  dc41: Persistant Unique Object Identifier UINT128 data type READ ONLY
  dc44: Name STRING data type READ ONLY
  dce0: Display Name STRING data type READ ONLY
  dc4e: Date Added STRING data type DATETIME FORM READ ONLY
  dc48: Description STRING data type READ ONLY
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>But wait a minute, what happened to the directory I created ?</p>

<p><code>sh
$ ls -ld /media/MTPDevice/
ls: cannot access /media/MTPDevice/: Transport endpoint is not connected
</code></p>

<p>Obviously I celebrated too soon. More trudging through posts. As an idea of how crazy this can seem, I found <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/159095/problems-connecting-android-ics-to-ubuntu-using-mtp">this post</a> on <a href="http://www.askubuntu.com">askubuntu</a> which said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please note the Terence Egan Blog where you took the instructions from is a copy of an OMG Ubuntu article. He has missed an important step <em>to restart your PC before running the Echo commands</em> I suggest you try and reinstall from the original OMG Ubuntu source. Click on this link&rdquo; (emphasis mine, link omitted).</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right, <em><em>N00b</em></em>. You forgot to restart.</p>

<p>(In case you&rsquo;re wondering how that story ends,
&ldquo;Oh my god!!! I did not know that. Will do this asap. – ubuntico Jul 3 &lsquo;12 at 16:40
It worked this way. <em>I connect the mobile and them immediately (under 1s after connection) I have to start command android-connect. Otherwise, the system will try to mount the mobile and after that I cannot use fuse to mount it.</em> It the same with you? – ubuntico Jul 3 '12 at 17:08&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m expecting too much, but I would not refer to this tenuous solution as <em>&ldquo;it worked&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Hmm, it looks like I skipped a step. I had to modify <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules</code> to add the right <code>SUBSYSTEM...</code> rule, and then <code>sudo service udev restart</code>.</p>

<p>Nope, no luck. I can&rsquo;t access, mount, unmount or delete.</p>

<p><code>sh
$ fusermount -u /media/MTPDevice
fusermount: entry for /media/MTPDevice not found in /etc/mtab
$ sudo mtpfs -o allow_other /media/MTPDevice/
fuse: bad mount point `/media/MTPDevice/': Transport endpoint is not connected
$ sudo rmdir /media/MTPDevice
rmdir: failed to remove `/media/MTPDevice': Device or resource busy
</code></p>

<p>But wait! All is not lost! We can use the <code>adb</code> tool to interact directly with the android filesystem!</p>

</code></p>

<p>and verify it after running <code>adb shell</code></p>

<p><code>sh
shell@scorpion_mini:/ $ ls sdcard/Music/                                       
Recovery [Explicit]
</code></p>

<p>So yeah. It works. And it&rsquo;s a <em>magical</em> experience.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>:
To add to my misery, I still can&rsquo;t <em>play</em> the songs. Google Play doesn&rsquo;t pick  them up (no surprise there) but neither does a dedicated music playing app like Winamp.</p>

<p>(Yes, <em>Winamp!</em> It&rsquo;s still around! It still plays the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKqKrH0O9yg">&ldquo;whips the llama&rsquo;s ass&rdquo; clip</a> when it starts! But it doesn&rsquo;t find my music ?!)</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, this is because on my phone, the sdcard is mounted on <code>/storage/sdcard1</code> instead of <code>/storage/sdcard0</code>, and that has made all the difference.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>:
I realized I could use the default file explorer app which came with the phone
to navigate to the external sd card and play music from there, so that works &hellip;</p>
