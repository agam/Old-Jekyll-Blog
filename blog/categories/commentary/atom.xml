    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might have come across Richard Stallman&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html">brief history of Lisp Machines</a>, which was a speech he gave in 2002. I remember coming across it &mdash; being inspired by what inspired him, and being outraged at what outraged him.</p>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;m souring on the whole <em>romantic</em> view of the &ldquo;free software&rdquo; that I&rsquo;d held for about a decade, a distinctly &ldquo;NoGPL&rdquo; view, if I may coin that word. Another nail in the coffin was delivered by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090901115039/http://danweinreb.org/blog/rebuttal-to-stallmans-story-about-the-formation-of-symbolics-and-lmi">this blog post</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, which refutes much of the blame to Symbolics, and leaves Stallman looking IMO quite silly (if not petulant).</p>

<p>Also &hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>And while Iâ€™m setting the record straight, the original (TECO-based) Emacs was created and designed by Guy L. Steele Jr. and David Moon. <strong>After they had it working, and it had become established as the standard text editor at the AI lab, Stallman took over its maintenance.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip; so much for RMS&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;But, along the way, I wrote a text editor, Emacs &hellip;&rdquo;</em>.</p>
