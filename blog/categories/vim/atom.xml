    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I used to have two giant monitors to work with, and reduced them to one since I
found myself frequently moving my neck from side to side.</p>

<p>I got rid of one of them, and felt much better after that &mdash; but now I was still
moving my neck up and down. When editing large source files (wait, why are these
files large to begin with ? That&rsquo;s a different conversation!), you do end up
tracking the cursor on each find, on each scroll.</p>

<p>The solution is obvious &mdash; as far as possible, keep the horizontal location of
the cursor fixed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure what the Emacs equivalent of this is, but if you use the <a href="http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/vi/">One True
Editor</a>, try typing <code>:help scrolloff</code> right now; you should see this:</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>                    *'scrolloff'* *'so'*
</code></pre>

<p>&lsquo;scrolloff&rsquo; &lsquo;so&rsquo;    number  (default 0)</p>

<pre><code>        global
        {not in Vi}
Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.
This will make some context visible around where you are working.  If
you set it to a very large value (999) the cursor line will always be
in the middle of the window (except at the start or end of the file or
when long lines wrap).
For scrolling horizontally see 'sidescrolloff'.
NOTE: This option is set to 0 when 'compatible' is set.
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>So you can add this to your <code>.vimrc</code> later, but try it out right now. Type</p>

<p><code>
:set scrolloff=999
</code></p>

<p>&hellip; and scroll around a bit.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

    <link href="http://agam.github.io/blog/2013/08/06/slimv/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve switched between Emacs and Vim a few times over the last 15-odd years, before finally (?) settling on Vim. I&rsquo;ve come to the realization, as many have before me, that for all the elegant awesomeness of Emacs Lisp,</p>

<blockquote><p>Vim is a better <em>text</em> editor, Emacs is good for everything else</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps one day if <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile</a> or <a href="https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/shanecelis/1">Emacsey</a> deliver their full promise, I&rsquo;ll happily live inside a REPL forever.</p>

<p>Until then, it&rsquo;s just <em>much, much, much</em> faster to do the equivalent <em>text</em> operations in Vim than in Emacs (yes, I mapped CapsLock to Control; yes, I replaced <code>M-</code> by <code>C-xC-m-</code>).</p>

<p>There were still a few Emacs-only things that haunted me (I outgrew the need to have a <a href="http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/">web browser</a> or an <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/erc.html">IRC client</a> in my editor environment, I now use Google Chrome for the former and BitchX/Irssi/Xchat for the latter. I also don&rsquo;t mind reading my <a href="http://gmail.com">email</a> in the browser), such as <a href="http://orgmode.org/"><code>org-mode</code></a>. Fortunately for me, I don&rsquo;t most of its features, and keeping a timestamped diary is something I was able to fix for myself with some shell scripting and vim shortcuts.</p>

<p>Recently, I decided to learn Common Lisp with as much of a newbie attitude as possible. And here I ran into a veritable wall of convention. <em>Of course, didn&rsquo;t I know, that Emacs + Slime is the one true way ?</em>
<em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Uh no, I take back that decision (why? maybe a future post to
answer that question)</p>

<p>I dithered, was flustered and nearly reconsidered.</p>

<p>And then I discovered the awesomeness I was looking for, a replacement for Slime in Vim, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2531">Slimv</a>!</p>

<p><a href="http://kovisoft.bitbucket.org/tutorial.html">Here is a tutorial</a> to get you started, but basically all I had to do was to install the plugin and the rest pretty much <em>just worked</em>.</p>

<p>There are quite a lot of nifty tricks here, but my most frequently used commands are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>,L</code>: that&rsquo;s a comma followed by L): compile current file</li>
<li><code>,D</code>: compile current form</li>
<li><code>,s</code>: lookup a short summary description of the keyword under the cursor</li>
<li><code>,c</code>: Open Slimv session (splits the window horizontally)</li>
</ul>


<p>I was also new to <code>paredit mode</code>, which is pretty much necessary for making changes to heavily nested parantheses, and it has useful commands there too:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>,W</code>: wrap an extra set of parentheses around the current form</li>
<li><code>,S</code>: it&rsquo;s opposite; remove <em>one</em> set of parentheses from the current form</li>
<li><code>,&lt;</code>, <code>,&gt;</code>: move the parentheses under the cursor one form to the left or right</li>
</ul>


<p>&hellip; and much more. So next time someone tells you how <code>Slime</code> is indispensable and hence Emacs is indispensable, throw <code>Slimv</code> in their face! Kudos to <a href="http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=16470">the guy who built it</a>!</p>
