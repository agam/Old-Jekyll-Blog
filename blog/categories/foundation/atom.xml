    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I liked this quote from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Techniques-Models-Computer-Programming/dp/0262220695">&ldquo;Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Programming as defined above has two essential parts: a technology and its scientific foundation.</p>

<p>The technology consists of tools, practical techniques, and
standards, allowing us to do programming.</p>

<p>The science consists of a broad and deep theory with predictive power, allowing us to understand programming. <em>Ideally, the science should explain the technology in a way that is as direct and useful as possible.</em></p>

<p>If either part is left out, we are no longer doing programming. <strong>Without the
technology, we are doing pure mathematics. Without the science, we are doing a
craft, i.e., we lack deep understanding</strong></p></blockquote>
